This is a bland generic description of this API. If you want, you can edit this file to display information which is actually useful. It will be displayed on top of the list of applications the logged in user has registered.

**TODO**: Find out whether having images in here will work.

What you definitely can do is having [links to other content](/content/example), as long as you make sure the access levels are the same. You shouldn't link to content which is requiring a different user group. Does not work well.
